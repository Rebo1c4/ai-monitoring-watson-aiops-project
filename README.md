Project summary: Modernizing Telecom Monitoring with IBM Netcool &amp; Watson AIOps

I led the modernization of a large-scale event and performance monitoring system for a telecom provider in Latin America, combining **IBM Netcool**, **IoT sensors**, and **Watson AIOps** to enable predictive insights and reduce operational noise.

We integrated hybrid data sources (SNMP, syslog, APIs), automated root cause correlation, and built real-time dashboards for faster decision-making. By implementing AI models with Watson AIOps, we reduced weekly alerts from **50,000 to under 10,000** and cut incident resolution time by **40%**.

This project included architecture design, technical demos, customer training, and full delivery â€” aligning with modern AIOps and observability practices.

## ðŸš€ Why It Matters

This project enabled a telecom provider to modernize legacy systems, reduce MTTR, and proactively address infrastructure issues. It showcases my end-to-end involvement, including:

- Monitoring strategy and AI-based automation
- Technical analysis, sizing, and architecture blueprint
- Solution design, integration planning, and installation
- Hands-on implementation across hybrid environments
- Documentation including HLDs, LLDs, Implementation Guides, Test Plans, SoWs, and MoPs

From the initial technical discovery to the final delivery, I supported the full lifecycle â€” combining hands-on expertise with clear communication, planning, and execution aligned to business outcomes.

Iâ€™m passionate about solving real operational problems using smart AI-driven tools â€” and this aligns with TRACTIANâ€™s mission to empower frontline maintenance through technology.
