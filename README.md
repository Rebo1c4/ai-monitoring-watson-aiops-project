# 📡 AI Monitoring & Automation Project: Netcool + Watson AIOps

**Project summary:** Modernizing Telecom Monitoring with IBM Netcool & Watson AIOps

I led the modernization of a large-scale event and performance monitoring system for a telecom provider in Latin America, combining **IBM Netcool**, **IoT sensors**, and **Watson AIOps** to enable predictive insights and reduce operational noise.

We integrated hybrid data sources (SNMP, syslog, APIs), automated root cause correlation, and built real-time dashboards for faster decision-making. By implementing AI models with Watson AIOps, we reduced weekly alerts from **50,000 to under 10,000** and cut incident resolution time by **40%**.

This project included architecture design, technical demos, customer training, and full delivery — aligning with modern AIOps and observability practices.

## 🚀 Why It Matters

This project enabled a telecom provider to modernize legacy systems, reduce MTTR, and proactively address infrastructure issues. It showcases my end-to-end involvement, including:

- 🧭 Monitoring strategy and AI-based automation
- 📐 Technical analysis, sizing, and architecture blueprint
- 🧩 Solution design, integration planning, and installation
- 🛠️ Hands-on implementation across hybrid environments
- 📄 Documentation including:
  - HLDs (High-Level Designs)
  - LLDs (Low-Level Designs)
  - Implementation Guides
  - Test Plans, SoWs, and MoPs

From the initial technical discovery to the final delivery, I supported the full lifecycle — combining hands-on expertise with clear communication, planning, and execution aligned to business outcomes.

💡 I’m passionate about solving real operational problems using smart AI-driven tools — and this aligns with **TRACTIAN’s mission** to empower frontline maintenance through intelligent, connected technology.
